Event Management System Application (EMSApp) üóìÔ∏è‚ú®
EMSApp is a desktop-based Java application designed to simplify event management tasks, including event planning, attendee registration, and venue management. Built using Swing, the application provides a modern, user-friendly graphical interface with interactive components and database integration.

üìã Project Overview
The EMSApp project is a feature-rich desktop application for organizing and managing events. It includes functionalities for planning events, registering attendees, and managing venues, with all data stored in a MySQL database for persistence and reliability.

The project aims to:

Enhance the user experience with a visually appealing and responsive interface.
Ensure ease of navigation with clearly defined modules for core functionalities.
Store and retrieve data efficiently using MySQL.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Java: Core language for application logic.
Swing: Used for building the GUI.
AWT: For additional UI enhancements and layout management.
MySQL Database: For storing event, attendee, and venue data.
MySQL Connector/J: For Java-MySQL database connectivity.
JOptionPane: For dialogs and user input handling.

üöÄ Setup Instructions
1. Clone or Download the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Happy-bot-ux/EMSApp.git  
cd EMSApp  
2. Set Up MySQL Database
Install MySQL Server and create a database for the application.
Import the provided SQL file to set up tables for events, attendees, and venues.
Example SQL Commands:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE emsapp;  
USE emsapp;  

CREATE TABLE events (  
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,  
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,  
    date DATE,  
    description TEXT  
);  

CREATE TABLE attendees (  
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,  
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,  
    email VARCHAR(255),  
    phone VARCHAR(20)  
);  

CREATE TABLE venues (  
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,  
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,  
    location VARCHAR(255),  
    capacity INT  
);  
3. Configure Database Connection
Update database connection settings in the code:
java
Copy code
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/emsapp";  
String user = "your_username";  
String password = "your_password";  
4. Ensure Java Environment
Install Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher.
5. Run the Application
Compile and execute the EMSApp.java file.
Use an IDE like NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse for a better development experience.
